# Mailing_Spyware
Python project using pillow, pynput and MIME

An little spyware that can be used to access any laptop's camera, keylogs and display context. Also the spy files will be directly mailed to any given mail.
The files are located in the temp folder, making it difficult to locate. 

I have also attached a .exe file that runs quietly in the background.
